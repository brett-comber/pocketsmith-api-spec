      description: The period to analyse in, one of `weeks`, `months` or `years`.
        Also supported is `event`, although event period analysis is only possible
        when the budget events gathered align, so in this case where all categories
        are analysed together, it's highly unlikely that event period analysis
        will be possible.

      description: The period interval, e.g. if the interval is 2 and the period
        is weeks, the budget will be analysed fortnightly.

      required: true
      description: A comma-separated list of scenario IDs to analyse. You're likely
        going to want to include all a user's scenarios here, unless you have
        reason to only analyse for a subset of scenarios. Regardless of what scenarios
        are analysed, all actuals (transactions) across all accounts will be included.
